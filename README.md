# Installation

The following libraries will need to be installed and/or updated to run the code in Anaconda v4.6 running python v3.*.
+ basemap -> conda install conda-forge::basemap
+ scikit-learn -> conda update scikit-learn


# Project Motivation

Airbnb is an online marketplace that provides accomodation sharing services to its users. Members use the online platform to arange or offer lodging. A new member intent on hosting would find pricing information valuable. Given airbnb's city data for Seattle for the year of 2016, I want to better understand:

1. How does the average daily listing price vary with time of year?
2. What factors influence listing prices in Seattle?
3. What (if any) influence does property type have on listing price?
3. What (if any) influence does location and monthly activity have 	   on listing prices?
4. How can a host set their listing price appropriately?

# File Descriptions

There is a single notebook contained in this repository to showcase work related to the above questions. Code is supplemented with ample documentation in the form of inline comments, docstrings and markdown cells. 

There is an additional .py file containing functions used in the main notebook.

# Results

The main findings can be found in the post available [here](https://medium.com/@josh_2774/how-do-you-become-a-developer-5ef1c1c68711)
